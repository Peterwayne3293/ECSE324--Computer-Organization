This reopository contains the laboratory projects done for the course ECSE 324, using ARMx86 Assembly and C.

## Description

Lab experiments were done using an ARM processor on an Altera DE1-SoC single board computer. The FPGA chip on the DE1-SoC has an ARM processor in was programmed.

Lab 1 - Process Management and Tiny Shell - Involved building a tiny shell to mimic a shell with running processes using Fork, Clone, VClone and FIFO, using assigned flags when running the shell.
